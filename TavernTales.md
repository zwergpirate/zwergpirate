A safespace for all your NPCs of your D&D campaign. Finally no NPC gets lost along the way and your players can remember their names, locations and descriptions. Yay! No more hours spent on creating new NPCs, just for your players to forget them, ignore them or try to kill them without any reason. Every NPC is important, because we are all someone else's NPC, right?

This app provides currently the following functions:

    Add NPCs to your NPC database
    Edit your NPC, just in case you realized you missed some important part of their backgroundstory
    Delete your NPC, if you want to get rid of them for good (your players don't remember anyways)
    Display of an NPC of the day, because everyone deserves their spotlight
    same functionalities for items
    same functionalities for monsters
    same functionalities for encounters

Future features:

    User authentication (user/ admin functionality)
    personal profile
    galery for all the slain monsters
    Encouter of the day
    maps with locations
    counter for your next session
    comment section for each template
